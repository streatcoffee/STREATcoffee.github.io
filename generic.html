										<h1>TakaSeat</h1>
										<h5>TakaSeat, a mobile application that assists students and staff members to efficiently move throughout a University.</h5>
									</header>
									<br>
									<h3>Overview</h3>
									<p>TakaSeat is a mobile application that tracks users location data to determine how busy areas are within a university campus. This data will be processed by the application and return an estimation/prediction on how congested that area is.</p>

									<p>Users are tracked via a unique identifier thus providing the application with a dataset relative to their connection to the university. If the user leaves the area that was initially predicted the application will adjust the prediction (weights) accordingly. </p>

									<p>TakaSeat includes features such as booking shared group study rooms, approximate wait times at elevators and food stall congestion within the university.</p>
									<br>

									<h3>Motivation</h3>
									<p>The motivation for this project comes from new students endlessly walking around campus to find an appropriate study area that isn’t occupied. New students to the university are unaware of all study areas available throughout the campus. Once all study areas are known the chance of finding an unoccupied seat and table to study at is still very slim. This application will provide all university stakeholders valuable information about the university.</p>
										<br>
									<h3>Description</h3>
									<p>TakaSeat tracks users via location sharing once an individual is in close proximity to the university and has downloaded the application, location sharing must be enabled. GPS coordinates and barometric pressure will be recorded, pushed and stored to the application. The application will take this information and run it against an algorithm to predict congestion in nearby common areas. GPS will compute altitude based on the longitude and latitude coordinates of the device. Barometric pressure readings will run in conjunction with stored GPS coordinates to determine the building level the user is on. Once the application has determined the building level the device is on, it will prompt the user on which service they wish to use.</p>
									<br> 
									<h3>Understanding the users location</h3>
									<p>The most challenging aspect of this project is accurately predicting the users location whilst in dense urban areas. Multi-path interference is a phenomenon occurring in dense urban areas where tall buildings are present. This phenomenon occurs when a GPS enabled device does not have a clear line of sight to the sky. Tall buildings can cause devices to split  signals into multiple thus causing errors in the application receiving an accurate reading.</p>

									<p>The longitude and latitude coordinates along with the attitude of each point of interest will be hard coded into the application. Once the user is within 5 meters of the border of a point of interest and the application is receiving consistent location results (no major fluctuations in longitude, latitude and attitude) the user will be allocated to that area. </p>
									<br>
									<h3>Features</h3>
									<h5>Tracking Shared Study Areas</h5>
									<p>Predicting the occupancy of shared study areas will be core feature of this application. A physical count of available seats in each study area will be conducted prior to release of the application. These numbers will be hard coded into the application as this variable is unlikely to experience major fluctuations.</p>
									
									<p>Once a user has entered a study area, the application will allocate his or her unique ID to that location. This allocation will adjust the number of seats available in that area. Once the user is detected out of the boundaries of the allocated area for more than 10 minutes, the users ID will be removed from the area thus opening an available seat. This 10 minute buffer will allow users to use the bathroom, get food or have a cigarette without affecting the applications prediction.</p>
									

									<p>Duration tracking with be implemented as this data will be used to refine the application in regards to how long a user in present in each location.</p>
									
									<h5>Tracking Food Court Areas</h5>
									<p>Food court areas will be tracked similar to shared study areas. Food courts are generally located on ground floors with an outside seating area. Ground floor data will be easier to capture as nothing or no one is present below this elevation. </p>
									
									<h5>Tracking Elevator Wait Times</h5>
									<p>Elevator wait times will be predicted by how many users are in the university along what time of the day it is. Location tracking in close proximity to elevators will provide inaccurate readings. The metal used in elevators and the structural support in elevators shafts will block or severely limit signals being transmitted to or from the users device. The time of day will be the backbone of this algorithm as users tend to be more active 10 minutes before classes or lectures begin. The application will run the time of day against users within the university and return an estimate on approximate wait times for nearby elevators. If the users altitude drops or rises quickly the application will know that the user has used an elevator. This dataset will be logged and used in future predictions.</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Booking a Group Study Room</h3>
									<p>Users will be able to book at group study room via TakaSeat. This feature will ensure all group study areas are being utilised at all times. If an area is not occupied a notification will be pushed to nearby users. The notification will only be pushed to a number of users that the room can hold. A first come, first serve basis will be implemented when making a booking.</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Visualising predictions:</h3>
									<p>Predictions will be visualised by displaying a colour behind each ‘point of interest’ tile within the application. The number of users in a certain location won’t be made public to ensure application usability and protect the universities intellectual property. A prediction will be made and displayed to the user regarding how long they’ll have to wait for a seat. Green tiles will indicate an area is under occupied while red tiles are experiencing more activity than usual.</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									<p>A successful outcome of this project will be visualized by increased productivity within the university. Stakeholders moving throughout the university with ease, students finding new and underutilized study areas and easing lunch time food court congestion.</p>
