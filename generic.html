									<h3>Motivation</h3>
									<p>During certain periods of the day, shared areas of RMIT can
										get extremely busy. The motivation for this project comes from
										walking around common study areas for 30 minutes trying to find
										an appropriate table and chair to study at. The city campus has
										45,000+ people enrolled yet only approximately 2,200 seats
										designed for study, most tables that host 4 students will have
										2 students sitting diagonally across from each other with their
										belongings sprawled across two seats, in turn, halving the number
										of available seats for other students. This platform will inform
										new students to the university of places that they can sit and
										study without endlessly walking around. This application will
										increase productivity of students that want to study during
										their breaks at university.</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Description</h3>
									<p>SitDown will track foot traffic through out certain areas
										of the university. This will be done by placing a microcontroller
										in these areas, the microcontroller will scan for probe packets
										sent by WIFI enabled devices and send the number of devices found
										to a web application. In certain locations RSSI signal strength
										will be recorded as this is a good indicator to differentiate the
										data collector between individuals passing by or students that
										are seated at tables.
										<br>
										<br>
										The microcontroller is ‘catching’ probe packet sent by WIFI
										enabled devices. Probe packet contain lots of different information
										although we are just looking for MAC addresses as each device
										will only send one address at a given time.
										<br>
										<br>
										MAC Addresses sent from devices will be randomised due the software
										updates from device manufactures. This will not affect the required
										data as we are looking for numbers of students in a specific area
										rather than knowing who that person is. Although knowing how long a
										specific student is in a certain area would be an ideal dataset to
										log as we could use that data to predict an average study duration.
										<br>
										<br>
										We will need to make some assumptions during testing as most students
										carry multiple WIFI enabled devices which in turn will increase the
										number of probe packet being received. These constraints will be
										tested and coded into the program before the project is shipped.
										<br>
										<br>
										Since the wireless protocol is based on connecting the device to the
										strongest signal, probe packets will still be sent periodically by
										devices that are already connected to a network. RSSI strength
										(received signal strength indication) can be used to determine how
										close or far a device(transmitter) is from the microcontroller(receiver).
										This data will be logged in certain areas as a microcontroller may be
										placed near a busy foot traffic walkway that might affect the true count.
										<br>
										<br>
										Once the application has the number of individuals within the range of
										the microcontroller the data will be pushed to a database where it can
										be reviewed. This data will be important as it will help development of
										the application predicting how many individuals are actually sitting down.
										Logged data will also show peak traffic times i.e 30 minutes past the hour
										when there’s more foot traffic as students are commuting to their next class.
										<br>
										<br>
										The data then will be sent to a webpage that will display asynchronous
										updates to inform the user how busy the area is. A PHP script will be used
										with conditional arguments that will trigger elements to change different
										colours based on the congestion in that area. PHP will be used as it is a
										server side scripting language. i.e If a study area can hosts 100 students,
										20 of those seats are tables with 4 seats we will assume half of them are
										being occupied, if RSSI is between -40 dBm to -100dBm the student is sitting
										at a table, else, the student is passing by etc...
										<br>
										<br>
										The script will perform these calculations and update the webpage accordingly.
										The script will push updates to the webpage every 60 seconds, this will give
										time for all microcontrollers to collect packets from different channels and
										send them to the server.
										<br>
										<br>
										This service will improve productivity throughout the uni while also providing
										the university valuable insights to how students move between university buildings.
